FIT2002 Assignment 2 Writing Guide and Template
Before submission, remove all guides, comments, and unnecessary instructions to ensure the final document is clean, professional, and ready for presentation.This guide aims to support your success in Assignment 2 by providing guidance on each deliverable within your project management plan. Remember, this is a starting point – your own exploration of project management concepts and tools will further enhance the quality of your submission.
Important Reminders:
● Don't leave this for the last minute!
● Prepare for change and updates; that is normal and expected.
● All templates are provided. You SHOULD adapt it to your project's unique needs.
● Ensure all deliverables (scope, WBS, Gantt chart, and cost baseline) are consistent. Inconsistencies can undermine the project plan. 
● Conceptual Understanding: Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the core project management principles covered in your coursework. These concepts serve as the foundation for each task within the assignment.
● Justification: Clearly explain your reasoning behind the choices, tools, or methods selected. Successful project plans demonstrate not only the 'what' but also the 'why' behind plans. 
● Professionalism in Writing: Use clear, organised, and error-free language throughout your plan. Present your ideas with the same level of care you would offer a client.
● Visual Clarity: Charts, tables, or diagrams can often communicate complex information or relationships more effectively than text alone.
● Accurate Referencing: Employ your designated referencing style. (APA 7) correctly and consistently to acknowledge your sources. Refer to Monash Library guidelines.● This document includes guides to develop your assignment tasks (presented in boxes) and templates to use. Remove the guides after completing the tasks and before submitting, to avoid an unnecessary indication of high similarity in Moodle!

DELIVERABLE 1: Project Integration Management
Task 1: Project CharterReflect on the alignment between your project's objectives and the client's business strategy. How does your project charter demonstrate an understanding of this alignment?A strong charter covers all elements in the template, clearly showing how they connect to deliver the project's value.Note: This document is developed after the project is initiated (started) and is different from a business case that is developed before the project starts.Another note: A project charter is very different from a team charter!Your project charter is an important communication tool. Ensure it is well-formatted, easy to navigate.Define success for the project in clear, measurable terms. For example, instead of "improve efficiency," aim to "reduce pr代 写FIT2002 Project Management   Assignment TwoR

Here are a few hints:Mapping Relationships: Develop a table or spreadsheet to illustrate how the project's requirements link to specific deliverables or design elements.You could go beyond merely listing requirements. Group or categorise requirements to emphasise dependencies or highlight those critical to project success.Requirements: This section should include a description of the requirement identified. Be sure to include both functional requirements (what the project, system, or product must DO) and non-functional requirements (qualities it must HAVE, such as performance, reliability).Assumption(s) and/or Customer Need(s):  This column should include a description of any assumption or customer needs linked to the requirement.Category: This column specifies whether the identified requirement is a functional requirement, service requirement, performance requirement, quality requirement, or training requirement.Source: This column specifies the source of the requirement. It could be the source document or the person or department initiating it.Status: This column should include the current status of the requirement; it can also include the expected date of completion.Task 2.2: Project Scope StatementBriefly explain the problem or opportunity the project addresses and how it aligns with the business objectives of your client. Every project document needs some introduction and background.Functional requirements (or business requirements) are capabilities that the product must have to satisfy specific stakeholder needs and/or expectations. They describe capabilities that the intended product can perform. to enable business users to do their work and carry on with their business (operational) work.Non-functional requirements are qualities that the product must have, including usability, performance, reliability, and security requirements. Technical requirements also fall under the non-functional category.Deliverable: Provide descriptions of each deliverable, outlining critical requirements and characteristics, and any relevant quality requirements or expectations.  Example: the new software system, training module, user manuals, etc.Include the most significant requirements/characteristics of each deliverable.Optional: Out-of-Scope: Explicitly state what the project will NOT address. This is just as important for managing expectations!DELIVERABLE 3: Project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Schedule
This deliverable has both individual work AND team collaboration. You will create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt chart for your individual project. You will also share these with your team, exchange constructive feedback, and improve them before adding them in your report.
Task 3.1: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Develop a WBS for your INDIVIDUAL PROJECT that clearly aligns with the project charter and scope statement.
Your WBS should be extended to Level 3 or 4 when appropriate, providing sufficient breakdown of the scope into summary tasks and work packages without being overly granular.
Your WBS should provide a clear and detailed understanding of all tasks required to complete the project.
Present your WBS in a list or tabular form. Avoid hierarchical presentation, as it has limitations and is hard to use for a WBS extended to levels 3 or 4.
The numbering format in the template is for demonstration purposes and to show you how a WBS extended to levels 3 and 4 could look like. You are free to use other reasonable numbering conventions.
